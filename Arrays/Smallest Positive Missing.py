You are given an integer array arr[]. Your task is to find the smallest positive number missing from the array.

Note: Positive number starts from 1. The array can have negative integers too.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, -3, 4, 1, 1, 7]
Output: 3
Explanation: Smallest positive missing number is 3.
Input: arr[] = [5, 3, 2, 5, 1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Smallest positive missing number is 4.
Input: arr[] = [-8, 0, -1, -4, -3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Smallest positive missing number is 1.
Constraints:  
1 â‰¤ arr.size() â‰¤ 105
-106 â‰¤ arr[i] â‰¤ 106

                arr[i] = temp

        # run a loop from 1 to the len of the arr
